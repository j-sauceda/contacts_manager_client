# README

This project has been built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), to create a React Typescript client application with Semantic-UI CSS, React-Query and Zustand. Here, the client makes use of the REST API built in the `nest_contacts_api` project in my GitHub profile. Finally, a running demonstration is available at [Vercel](https://nest-react-contacts.vercel.app/).
